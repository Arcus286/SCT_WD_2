Interactive Stopwatch Web Application

Project Overview

This is a modern, responsive interactive stopwatch application built using vanilla web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary goal is to provide users with a tool to accurately measure time, manage intervals, and record lap times with high precision.

The application is designed to be easily readable and fully functional across desktop and mobile devices.

Key Features

Toggle Control: A single button dynamically switches between the "Start" (green) and "Pause" (yellow/orange) functions, managing the timer state.

Lap Recording: Users can capture intermediate lap intervals while the main timer continues to run.

Total Time Display: Tracks and displays the elapsed time in Minutes:Seconds:Centiseconds (MM:SS:msms) format using a large, clear, monospaced font.

Reset Function: Clears the main timer, stops the interval, and deletes all previously recorded lap history.

Lap History Log: Records and displays all recorded lap times, with the newest lap appearing at the top of the list for easy tracking.

Technologies Used

The stopwatch is built entirely using standard front-end technologies:

HTML5: Provides the structural elements for the display, control buttons, and the lap history list.

CSS3: Used for all styling, including centering the application, setting the typography, managing responsive layouts, and applying color coding for button states.

JavaScript (ES6+): The core logic for time management, handling the setInterval loop, calculating time format, managing the application state, and dynamic DOM manipulation for laps.

How to Run

Since this application is built exclusively with client-side code, you can run it instantly:

Ensure you have your three files (index.html, your CSS file, and script.js) in the same folder.

Open the main HTML file (index.html) using any modern web browser.

No server or special setup is required.
